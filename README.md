High-performance CLI for building quality context windows that make AI assistants actually understand your codebase.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants are only as good as the context you provide. Most tools simply concatenate files, leading to:

- **Irrelevant files** cluttering the context window
- **Missing dependencies** that are crucial for understanding
- **Token limits** wasted on unimportant code
- **No understanding** of how your code actually connects

## The Solution

context-creator uses tree-sitter to build a dependency graph of your codebase, selecting only the files relevant to your task. It's like repomix, but faster and smarter.

### Without context-creator
```bash
# Generic context that includes everything
cat src/**/*.ts > context.txt  # 500K tokens of mostly noise
```

### With context-creator
```bash
# Intelligent context that follows your code's actual dependencies
context-creator --prompt "How does the authentication work?"
# Returns: auth files + their actual dependencies + related tests = 50K relevant tokens
```

## Key Advantages

- **Dependency-aware**: Uses tree-sitter AST parsing to understand imports, not just file names
- **Fast**: Rust-powered parallel processing handles massive codebases in seconds
- **Smart selection**: Includes only files connected to your query through the dependency graph
- **Multi-language**: Semantic analysis for Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Rust
- **MCP integration**: Works as a server for AI assistants to query your codebase programmatically

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g context-creator-mcp@latest
```

For platform-specific MCP client setup, see [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Analyze current directory
context-creator

# Build focused context for specific task
context-creator --prompt "Find security vulnerabilities in the auth system"

# Trace dependencies of specific files
context-creator --trace-imports --include "**/auth.py"

# Compare changes with dependency context
context-creator diff HEAD~1 HEAD

# Enrich code with OpenTelemetry runtime metrics
context-creator telemetry -t traces.json
```

### MCP Server

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-creator": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "context-creator-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then in your AI assistant:
```
"Explain how the payment system works" # AI will use analyze_local to build relevant context
"Find all SQL injection vulnerabilities" # Searches with full dependency understanding
```

## Features
